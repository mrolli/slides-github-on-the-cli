# What is Github CLI (gh)?

<v-click>

gh brings GitHub to your terminal. Free and open source.

gh has come to stay as first-class building block in the GitHub universe
(130 releases in 3.5y!)


gh is written in Go and therefore available on any platform.

</v-click>

<v-click>

<br />

## Ok, but why should I use GitHub CLI?

</v-click>

<v-click>

> Goodbye, context switching between your terminal and your browser
for a seamless and mouse-less efficient developer experience.

* **Entire GitHub workflow:** Work with issues, pull request, checks, release and more on the CLI
* **Script, automate and customize** almost any action with builtin commands
* **GitHub API:** eventually also everything else available via the GitHub API
* **Enterprise-ready:** works with GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Server

# Where can I get help on GitHub CLI?

gh has an excellent built-in help that follow common usage:

```bash
gh --help
gh COMMAND [SUBCOMMAND] --help
```

These built-in help texts are also available as a manual at https://cli.github.com/manual.

The official micro-website on Github CLI is at https://cli.github.com with a
short visual introduction to the tool and links to the **manual** and the **release
notes**. The latter are well maintained and a good read after every upgrade.

gh is open source. Find the repo at https://github.com/cli/cli

# Getting Started

Installing and Configuring

# Installing the GitHub CLI binary

Follow the installation instructions at https://github.com/cli/cli#installation
for your platform.

For me on macOS using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install gh
```

<br />

<v-click>

**On macOS:**  
gh is available via Homebrew, MacPorts, Conda, Spack

**On Windows:**  
gh is available via WinGet, scoop, Chocolatey, Conda, and as downloadable MSI.

**On Linux:**  
gh is available either via official repos or as package downloads - see
[Installing gh on Linux and BSD](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md)

# Authenticating to GH and GHES

#### Login to github.com or our GHES

```bash
gh auth login
```

# Authentication (cont.)

#### Show current authentication status

```bash
gh auth status
```

# Manage Permission Scopes

As an example, we are going to add the read:project permission scope to the
GHES token:

```bash
gh auth refresh --scopes read:project --hostname github.unibe.ch
```

For more information on managing permission scopes, see gh auth refresh --help

<br />

# Setup the gh Credential Helper

Configure git to use GitHub CLI as the credential helper for all authenticated hosts

```bash
gh auth setup-git
```

This edits your git configuration file.

GENERAL COMMANDS
  create:      Create a new repository
  list:        List repositories owned by user or organization

TARGETED COMMANDS
  archive:     Archive a repository
  clone:       Clone a repository locally
  delete:      Delete a repository
  deploy-key:  Manage deploy keys in a repository

# Listing Repositories

Show all repos my Repositories on github.com

```bash
gh repo list idsys-unibe-ch
```

List all repos of IDSYS on our GHES
```bash
GH_HOST=github.unibe.ch gh repo list idsys-unibe-ch
```

Having a hard-coded environment variable is not an ideal solution when you are
using both GitHub platforms, therefore an elegant alias might come in handy:

```bash
# Add this to your .bashrc or .zshrc
alias lgh="GH_HOST=github.unibe.ch gh"
```

# On Merge Strategies

When working with PR, Github features three different merge methods:

* Merge pull request
* Squash and merge
* Rebase and merge

The allowed merge methods can be configured on a per repo basis.

> In a project, wisely choose one and stick to it! There is no right or false!

More information on this topic:

* [Official documentation on merge methods](https://docs.github.com/de/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/about-merge-methods-on-github)
* [GitHub Merge straegies explained by examples](https://github.com/MarcBoissonneault/github-merge-strategies)

Also mentioned here shall be the [merge queue feature](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-a-merge-queue) that GitHub offers.

You can use Vue components directly inside your slides.

We have provided a few built-in components like `<Tweet/>` and `<Youtube/>` that you can use directly. And adding your custom components is also super easy.

```html
<Counter :count="10" />
```

<!-- ./components/Counter.vue -->
<Counter :count="10" m="t-4" />
